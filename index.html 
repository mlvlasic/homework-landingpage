	From Joni: Overall comments

	Hi Matt!  I am going to write comments to your code in HTML comments like this one.

	Overall, great job with formatting your HTML so that your code is indented for the most part.  Just 
	remember to be consistent with your indenting, but your code is pretty easy to read, which is great.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<!--
			Regarding these stylesheet declarations, always make sure that your link to the reset.css
			file comes *before* your link to any other style sheets.  Otherwise, the styles in reset.css
			will override styles in your other .css files.  So.. order matters here.

			Also, there is no reset.css file in your code base.

	<body>
	   <!-- 
	       Since this first div is at the top of the page and contains your logo, etc, think about other
	       semantic HTML tags you can use - i.e. <header>
	   -->
	   <div class="first">
		<h1>Relaxr</h1>
		<h2>Get piece of mind with a single tap</h2> <!-- Great use of <h1> vs. <h2> here! -->

	   <!-- 
	       For the rest of these blocks, think about other semantic HTML tags you can use instead of the 
	       <div> tag - i.e. <section>.  Nothing wrong with the <div> tag, but ideally, it should be used
	       as a last resort if you cannot find a more appropriate HTML tag to use for these overarching
	       sections.
